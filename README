There are a few development guidelines that should be followed:
  - Naming conventions must be underscores and not CamelCase.
  - Tabs must be converted to 2 spaces.
  - Credit should not be given in the code but in the pull request.
  - Large re-writes should be discussed beforehand on the forums to avoid undoing the work of others.
